# dotfiles
dotfiles, dotfiles, dotfiles!  and a script to link them into the home directory.
# 

Usage:  Clone the repository somewhere, then run link_dotfiles.sh.  

Copies of the scripts that will be replaced are moved into a directory in the dotfiles/backups/ directory and 
links are made between the dotfiles from the repo and the home directory.
